A repository demonstrating GitHub integration with Model Context Protocol (MCP)

# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI models to securely connect to external data sources and services. It provides a standardized way for AI applications to integrate with various tools, databases, and APIs while maintaining security and control.

## What is MCP?

MCP is a protocol that defines how AI models can:
- **Connect to external services** - Databases, APIs, file systems, and more
- **Access real-time data** - Get up-to-date information from various sources
- **Perform actions** - Execute commands, create files, make API calls
- **Maintain security** - Control access and permissions for different resources

## Key Features

### üîå **Standardized Integration**
- Unified interface for connecting to different services
- Consistent API across various data sources
- Easy to implement and maintain

### üîí **Security First**
- Granular permission controls
- Secure authentication mechanisms
- Audit trails and logging

### üöÄ **Extensible Architecture**
- Plugin-based system
- Custom server implementations
- Support for various protocols and formats

### üìä **Rich Data Access**
- Structured and unstructured data support
- Real-time and batch processing
- Multiple data formats (JSON, XML, CSV, etc.)

## How MCP Works

1. **MCP Server** - Exposes resources and tools from external services
2. **MCP Client** - AI application that consumes MCP services
3. **Protocol Layer** - Standardized communication between client and server
4. **Resource Management** - Handles data access, caching, and permissions

## Common Use Cases

### üìÅ **File System Access**
```javascript
// Example: Reading files through MCP
const fileContent = await mcp.readFile('/path/to/document.txt');
```

### üóÑÔ∏è **Database Integration**
```javascript
// Example: Querying databases
const results = await mcp.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE active = true');
```

### üåê **API Integration**
```javascript
// Example: Making API calls
const response = await mcp.apiCall('GET', '/api/v1/users');
```

### üîß **Tool Execution**
```javascript
// Example: Running system commands
const output = await mcp.execute('git status');
```

## MCP Server Types

### **Built-in Servers**
- File system access
- Database connections
- Git operations
- Web scraping

### **Third-party Servers**
- GitHub integration
- Slack connectivity
- Google Drive access
- Custom business tools

## Benefits for Developers

- **Reduced Integration Time** - Standard protocol eliminates custom implementations
- **Better Security** - Built-in permission and authentication systems
- **Improved Reliability** - Standardized error handling and retry mechanisms
- **Enhanced Debugging** - Consistent logging and monitoring capabilities

## Getting Started

### 1. Install MCP Client
```bash
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/client
```

### 2. Configure MCP Server
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@smithery/cli", "run", "@smithery-ai/github"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Connect and Use
```javascript
const mcp = new MCPClient();
await mcp.connect('github');
const repos = await mcp.listRepositories();
```

## Example: GitHub Integration

This repository demonstrates MCP integration with GitHub, allowing AI models to:
- Create and manage repositories
- Read and write files
- Manage issues and pull requests
- Access repository metadata
